The Continuous Testing Tool (CTT) provides functionality for defining, generating, executing, and refining continuous tests of  application functions, data pipelines and microservices, as well as for  reporting test results. While targeting to provide a general framework  for continuous quality testing in RADON, a particular focus of CTT is on testing workload-related quality attributes such as performance,  elasticity, and resource/cost efficiency.
