The *Continuous Testing Tool* (short: *CTT*) provides functionality for defining, generating, executing, and refining continuous tests of application functions, data pipelines, and microservices, as well as for reporting test results. CTT is a standalone tool that extends the `OASIS Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) <http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tosca>`_ ecosystem and the TOSCA-based `RADON <https://radon-h2020.eu/>`_ framework. While targeting to provide a general framework for continuous quality testing, a particular focus of CTT is on testing workload-related quality attributes such as performance,  elasticity, and resource/cost efficiency.
